## From the Team

### AI that understands what matters

Our founders,witnessed something troubling: while AI models grew increasingly sophisticated, they carried an inherent English bias—ignoring the rich tapestry of vernacular languages like Punjabi and Hindi that billions speak daily. The very communities that could benefit most from AI's transformative power found themselves locked out by linguistic barriers. In courtrooms across Punjab, they saw legal professionals struggling with rudimentary translation tools that mangled critical contract clauses. Government offices relied on painfully slow, manual processes that should have been automated years ago. 

The breaking point came when they realized the cascading effects: delayed justice due to mistranslated evidence, lost opportunities due to language barriers, and government efficiency hampered by archaic workflows. While Silicon Valley celebrated AI breakthroughs, entire communities remained excluded from the revolution happening around them.

With a vision to bring transformative change, our founders refused to accept this status quo.Incorporated in Chandigarh in 2024, Xieta AI emerged from their unwavering belief that linguistic diversity should be a strength, not a limitation. Our team of engineers, linguists and legal experts work shoulder-to-shoulder from our registered office in Punjab, not just translating words, but democratizing access to AI's promise—ensuring that cutting-edge technology serves every community with the precision and respect they deserve.

## Our Vision

Xieta envisions a future where artificial intelligence removes barriers between intention and execution. We see a world where language complexities dissolve, where critical information surfaces instantly, and where professionals across sectors can focus on what matters most—serving their communities and advancing their missions.

Our vision spans the intersection of technology and public service. We believe AI should democratize access to expertise, whether that’s helping bridge linguistic divides, empowering legal professionals with instant access to precedents and analysis, or enabling public servants to navigate complex administrative processes with clarity and confidence.
